# PLAY!

This is a simple Tic Tact Toe where two persons play on 3x3 grid. Players can put either X (concha) or O (churro) in an empty cell in the grid.
I'm implementing:
<ul>
  <li>Client</li>
    <ul>
      <li>jQuery</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>SCSS</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Build System</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Grunt</li>
      <li>Webpack</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Deployment</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Github Pages</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Version Control</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>Github</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
